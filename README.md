🔑 Key Insights

Overall churn rate: ~27%

Customers with month-to-month contracts have a much higher churn rate (46%) compared to yearly contracts (7%)

Top churn reasons:

Competitor offers

High prices

Service dissatisfaction

Customers subscribed to unlimited data plans or international calling showed higher churn

💡 Interesting Insight

Some customers pay for international calls but never use them, which may lead to perceived wasted spending.

👉 A customer-centric strategy could include:

Educating customers about their usage

Recommending more suitable and affordable plans

This builds trust and reduces churn by showing genuine care for customer needs.
